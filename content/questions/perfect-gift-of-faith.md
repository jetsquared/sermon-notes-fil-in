# Title: God Gives a Perfect Measure of Faith to Imperfect People

## Scripture: Genesis 16

## Main Points:

- The chapter of **Genesis 16** has 16 verses, with 11 verses focused on Hagar and 5 verses focused on Abram and Sarai.
- **Genesis 16** is a story of desperation, distress, impatience, frustration, and haste, but also of hope, new beginnings, God's mercy, and provision.
- The characters in **Genesis 16** are imperfect and attempt to solve their problems with human solutions, but God gives each of them a measure of faith.
- The sermon explores three pictures of faith:
  - The **flailing faith** of Abram
  - The **frustrated faith** of Sarai
  - The **foundational faith** of Hagar
- **Abram's faith** is described as flailing, meaning he is waving about uncontrollably, struggling to achieve something or manage a situation. Abram grabs onto Sarai’s plan to have a child through Hagar to try to regain balance in his life.
- **Sarai's frustrated faith** leads her to offer her servant Hagar to Abram. Sarai is frustrated by the fact that she has been childless for 10 years. Sarai's actions are compared to Eve giving the fruit to Adam in the Garden of Eden.
- **Hagar**, though marginalized and without agency, encounters God in her suffering and emerges with a sense of being seen and divinely affirmed. Her experience is compared to the historical struggles of black communities.
- **Faith** is defined as trust in God, a commitment to God, action aligned with belief, reliance on God’s grace, and perseverance in the face of trials.
- **Hagar** is called by name by the angel of the Lord and is told to return to her mistress. The angel of the Lord tells her she will have a son named Ishmael, meaning "God hears".
- Hagar names God, "Elroy" meaning “the God who sees me”.
- **Abram** names Hagar's child Ishmael, which is what the Lord told Hagar to name her son. This action by Abram strengthens the perfect measure of faith that God imparted to Hagar.
