**Main Scripture: Psalm 19:12**

## Introduction:

- Psalm 19 is a Davidic Psalm, meaning it was written by King David.
- The Psalm can be broken into three sections:
- Verses 1-6 describe the beauty of #blank %God's creation%
- Verses 7-11 describe the purity and renewing power of #blank %God's word%
- Verses 12-14 express the proper #blank of our hearts. %response%
- Verse 12 highlights the need for #blank because there are things in us we are unaware of. %confession%
- The sermon suggests that this topic relates to #blank, and who we trust. %spiritual warfare%

### Key Ideas in Psalm 19:12

- The verse asks, "Who can perceive their #blank sins?". %errors%
- "Errors" can also be translated as #blank or mistaken sins. %unintentional%
- The word "cleanse" means to #blank, removing all blame. %pardon%
- The verse speaks about "hidden faults", which are #blank faults. %secret%

## Main Points:

### 1. **Did you ignore all the warning signs?**

- The church has often avoided #blank commentary, leading to a lack of guidance for believers. %political%
- This avoidance has become a #blank for the church, and has impacted dinner table conversations, and the workplace. %blind spot%
- Instead of seeking Godly discussion, many turn to #blank for easy answers. %TV personalities%
- The main idea is not to blame, but to recognize #blank sins. %unintentional%
- Unintentional sins are not hidden in the sense of physically hiding, but are hidden from our own #blank. %perception%
- Even though we are unaware of them, we are still #blank for them. %responsible%
- The Bible makes a big deal over things that we don&apos;t even know exist.
- In the Old Testament, God required a #blank for unintentional sins. %sacrifice%
- We are responsible for our actions against God&apos;s commands even when we don&apos;t know better.
- A real relationship with God requires us to be #blank before Him. %vulnerable%
- We often seek protection through #blank, similar to Adam and Eve covering themselves with fig leaves after the fall. %fig leaves%
- Christians have often sought the protection of the #blank, instead of trusting God. %state%
- We are given many warning signs through scripture and the attempts of seeking protection from others.
- The right knowledge is found in #blank, not just any knowledge. %God's word%
- Prophets in the Old Testament spoke to #blank without being political. %politics%
- God is the ultimate source of #blank and justice. %truth%
- We cannot guarantee #blank, but we can guarantee that God will never leave us. %protection%

### 2. **Come on, really, everyone else is wrong?**

- This question addresses a tendency to think that we are #blank. %never wrong%
- The image of a donkey and elephant sinking represents that both political sides have #blank and are bringing down the system. %holes%
- Even if we follow the rules of our household or our country, it won&apos;t get us into #blank. %heaven%
- Democracy can be traced back to ancient #blank, then the #blank, then Enlightenment thinkers. %Athens% %Magna Carta%
- The U.S. Constitution is a great document but not #blank. %God's word%
- We have been trained to revere the Constitution and we need to be aware of that.
- We can be #blank, offended by everything. %hypersensitive%
- A hidden sin can be never wanting to be wrong, which can become an #blank. %addiction%
- This addiction to never be wrong blinded the #blank to the Savior. %Pharisees%
- Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do," in the face of the self-righteousness of others.
- Our hidden sins are a matter of #blank and death. %life%
- The burning we feel in response to something may be the #blank, which convicts us of sin. %Holy Spirit%
- Don&apos;t grieve the Holy Spirit, but use the feeling to confess our hidden faults.
- God wants us to point people to #blank, not to be the voice of reason. %truth%

## Conclusion:

- The key takeaway from the sermon is that everyone has #blank that need to be confessed and cleansed by God. As Christians it is our responsibility to be vulnerable with God and seek His truth rather than relying on inadequate means of protection such as political alliances. Additionally, the desire to #blank can be an addiction that blinds us to truth and leads to self-righteousness; it is so important to be open to correction, even from our fellow believers and seek God's perspective. %hidden sins% %never be wrong%
